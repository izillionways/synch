If you search for free Obsidian sync, someone will eventually say: just use Git.

That advice is common in forums and Reddit threads. Obsidian notes are Markdown files. Git is free. Sites like GitHub can store a copy of your vault. On paper, it sounds perfect.

If you do not already use Git, it can also feel confusing fast.

Git is not a sync button. It is a system for saving snapshots of folders over time, then sending those snapshots between computers. Developers use it every day for code. Note-taking users can use it too, but the habits are different from iCloud, Dropbox, or Obsidian Sync.

So the real question is not simply:

> Can Git sync Obsidian?

It is:

> Do you want to learn a developer-style save-and-upload workflow just to keep your notes in sync?

This guide explains Obsidian Git sync in plain language, what people like about it, where it gets hard for everyday Obsidian users, and when an end-to-end encrypted alternative like Synch is simpler.

## What Git Is, in Obsidian Terms

Think of Git as a careful notebook history system, not as automatic cloud sync.

In everyday language:

- A **repository** is your vault folder plus a hidden history of changes.
- A **commit** is a snapshot: "save the current state of my notes."
- A **push** is uploading those snapshots to an online copy, often on GitHub.
- A **pull** is downloading newer snapshots from that online copy onto another device.
- A **merge conflict** is what happens when two devices changed the same note before they saw each other.

Git does not quietly keep every device up to date while you write. Your notes move when snapshots are saved and transferred.

That is the core tradeoff.

With a normal sync service, you edit a note and expect the other device to catch up.

With Git, you edit a note, save a snapshot, upload it, then make sure the other device downloads it before you keep editing there.

## What Obsidian Git Sync Usually Looks Like

Most "Obsidian Git sync" setups work like this:

1. You turn your vault folder into a Git repository.
2. You save snapshots of your note changes.
3. You upload those snapshots to a private online repository.
4. On another computer, you download the same repository and open it in Obsidian.

Many people use the [Obsidian Git](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git) community plugin so they can do more of this from inside Obsidian, without living in a terminal.

The basic path looks like this:

```txt
Obsidian vault on device A
        |
save a snapshot + upload
        |
online Git copy
        |
download the latest snapshot
        |
Obsidian vault on device B
```

The online Git copy is the middle point between devices. That can work well if you are careful.

It still depends on you, or a plugin, remembering to save and transfer snapshots. Editing a note is not the same thing as syncing a note.

## Why People Recommend Git Anyway

People recommend Git because it can be free, transparent, and good at history.

What you get:

- A free or low-cost way to keep an online copy of your vault
- A detailed history of note changes over time
- A way to compare older and newer versions of a Markdown note
- More control than dropping your vault into a random cloud folder
- A setup that does not require paying for Obsidian Sync

That sounds attractive if you want free sync and you care about recovering old versions.

It is less attractive if what you really want is: open Obsidian on your phone, write a quick note, and trust that your laptop will see it soon.

## What You Need Before Trying Git

If you are new to Git, expect a learning curve before the first smooth sync day.

You will usually need to understand:

- How to create a private online repository
- How to connect Obsidian to that repository
- How to save a snapshot of your notes
- How to upload and download changes
- What to do when two versions of the same note disagree
- Which files should not be saved into history

You also need a separate backup before you start. Copy your whole vault somewhere safe first. Sync tools can copy mistakes quickly. Git is no exception.

A few setup details matter more than they sound:

- Keep the online repository **private** unless you intentionally want public notes.
- Decide early whether Obsidian settings inside `.obsidian` should be included.
- Avoid putting passwords, tokens, or secret plugin settings into the repository.
- Do not also sync the same vault with iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, or Syncthing at the same time.

If those steps already feel like too much overhead, Git is probably not the sync method you want.

## When Git Can Work Well

Git can work for Obsidian when your routine is calm and mostly desktop-based.

It is a better fit when:

- Your vault is mostly text notes, not lots of photos and PDFs
- You edit mainly on one computer at a time
- You are willing to download the latest notes before writing on another device
- You like the idea of a detailed history more than invisible background sync
- You do not mind learning a few new concepts
- Your phone is secondary, not your main writing place

A realistic good day with Git looks like this:

1. Open Obsidian on your laptop.
2. Make sure you have the latest notes.
3. Write for a while.
4. Save a snapshot.
5. Upload it.
6. Later, on another computer, download before editing again.

If that rhythm feels natural, Git can be reliable.

If you often bounce between phone and laptop without thinking about sync status, Git will fight you.

## Where Obsidian Git Sync Gets Hard

### 1. It does not feel like normal sync

In Obsidian Sync, iCloud, or a dedicated sync app, the mental model is simple: edit here, see it there.

In Git, the mental model is: edit here, save a snapshot, upload, then download over there.

Plugins can automate some of that. They cannot remove the underlying idea. If a snapshot never got uploaded, the other device will not have your note.

### 2. Conflicts interrupt writing

If your phone and laptop both edit the same note before syncing, Git cannot silently guess which version is right. You may see conflict markers inside the note and have to clean them up yourself.

That is safer than silently deleting one version. It is still annoying when you only wanted to jot something down.

For a broader explanation of how Obsidian sync conflicts happen across tools, see [why Obsidian notes get duplicated or disappear during sync](/blog/obsidian-sync-conflicts).

### 3. Phones are the weak point

Desktop Git setups are already a project. Mobile Git setups are harder.

On a phone, you may need extra apps, extra login steps, or a fragile plugin workflow. Quick capture becomes slower. Conflict repair becomes harder. Large vaults become heavier.

If your main reason for sync is "I write on my phone during the day," Git is usually the wrong first choice.

### 4. Images and PDFs make things heavier

Git remembers history. That is great for text. It is awkward for big files.

If your vault has many images, PDFs, or recordings, the online copy can grow quickly. Deleting a large file later does not always shrink the history. Media-heavy vaults are usually happier in a sync system built for mixed files.

### 5. Private is not the same as encrypted

A private GitHub repository is hidden from the public internet. That is good.

It is not the same as end-to-end encryption.

If your notes are uploaded as normal Markdown, the Git host can store readable note contents. For diaries, health notes, work notes, or anything sensitive, that difference matters.

Synch encrypts vault data on your device before upload, so the sync server stores encrypted data rather than readable notes. If you want the plain-English technical version, read [how Synch's end-to-end encryption works](/blog/encryption-and-decryption).

### 6. Two sync systems on one vault is a common disaster

Do not put a Git-managed vault inside iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, or Syncthing and also let Git automate snapshots. Two systems fighting over the same folder is a classic way to get duplicates, missing edits, and confusing history.

Pick one active sync method for the vault you write in every day.

## Git vs Synch

Git and Synch are trying to solve different problems.

Git is a history-and-transfer toolkit. Synch is an open-source, end-to-end encrypted sync service built for Obsidian.

| Question | Git | Synch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| What is it for? | Saving note history and moving snapshots between devices | Syncing an Obsidian vault |
| Do you need to learn special steps? | Yes: snapshots, upload, download, conflict cleanup | Much less |
| Does it feel like normal sync? | Only if you automate carefully | Yes, that is the goal |
| Are notes end-to-end encrypted by default? | No, not on a normal Git host | Yes, encrypted on your device before upload |
| Phone-friendly? | Often difficult | Built for multi-device Obsidian use |
| Best for | People who want Git-style history and can manage the workflow | People who want private Obsidian sync without learning Git |

Git is attractive when history and control are the point, and you are willing to operate the system.

Synch is attractive when you want your notes to move between devices without turning note-taking into repository maintenance.

## When Git Might Still Be Worth It

Choose Git if:

- You are curious enough to learn the basics slowly
- You mostly write on desktop
- Your vault is text-first
- You want a detailed change history
- You are okay pausing to sync on purpose
- A private repository is private enough for your notes

Even then, start small. Use a test vault first. Do not begin with your only copy of years of notes.

## When Synch Is a Better Fit

Choose Synch if what you actually want is Obsidian sync, not a mini Git project.

Synch is a better fit when:

- You do not want to learn commits, pulls, and merges just to sync notes
- You write on both desktop and mobile
- You want end-to-end encryption by default
- You want hosted sync without using a general cloud drive
- You want a free or low-cost alternative to Obsidian Sync
- You want fewer moving parts than Git plus a plugin plus a remote host

The current Synch Free plan includes one synced vault, 30 MB of storage, a 3 MB maximum file size, and 1 day of version history. The Starter plan includes one synced vault, 1 GB of storage, a 5 MB maximum file size, and 1 month of version history.

That makes Synch practical for small personal vaults, students, hobby notes, and anyone who wants private encrypted sync without learning developer tooling first.

If you are still comparing options, see [best Obsidian Sync alternatives in 2026](/blog/obsidian-sync-alternatives) and [free Obsidian sync options](/blog/free-obsidian-sync).

## If You Try Git Anyway

Keep the setup boring and careful.

1. Copy your whole vault somewhere safe first.
2. Use a private online repository.
3. Start with a small test vault if you can.
4. Learn one loop well: download latest, write, save snapshot, upload.
5. On a second device, always download before editing.
6. Avoid editing the same note on two devices at once.
7. Keep large attachments out when possible.
8. Do not combine Git with another sync tool on the same folder.

If the first week feels stressful instead of helpful, that is useful information. Git may be powerful, but it may not be the right sync tool for your note-taking life.

## FAQ

### Can Git sync Obsidian if I am not a developer?

Yes, it can work, but expect a learning curve. Git was built for software history, not for casual note sync. Many Obsidian users can learn enough to make it work. Many others decide they wanted sync, not a new system to manage.

### Is the Obsidian Git plugin enough by itself?

It helps on desktop by giving you buttons and automation inside Obsidian. It does not remove the need to understand snapshots, uploads, downloads, conflicts, and privacy settings.

### Is Git a good free Obsidian Sync alternative?

It can be free or cheap, yes. The hidden cost is time and attention. If free matters most and you enjoy tinkering, Git can be worth trying. If you want notes to sync with less thinking, look at a dedicated sync option.

### Is a private GitHub repository end-to-end encrypted?

No. Private means other people cannot casually browse it. It does not mean the host only stores scrambled data it cannot read. If you need end-to-end encrypted hosted sync, use a tool designed for that.

### Should I use Git or Synch?

Use Git if you want note history in a repository and you are willing to learn the workflow. Use Synch if you want private, end-to-end encrypted Obsidian sync without managing Git yourself.

### Can I use Git and Synch together?

Not on the same live vault. You can keep a separate backup copy somewhere else, but do not let two active sync systems manage one working folder.

## Bottom Line

Git can sync an Obsidian vault. For some people, especially careful desktop writers who like history, it works well.

For many everyday Obsidian users, it is the wrong first answer. It asks you to think in snapshots, uploads, downloads, and conflict cleanup. That is a lot of ceremony if all you wanted was notes on every device.

If you enjoy learning Git and your workflow is mostly desktop text notes, Obsidian Git sync can be a strong free option.

If you want private Obsidian sync with end-to-end encryption and less to manage, Synch is built for that job.
